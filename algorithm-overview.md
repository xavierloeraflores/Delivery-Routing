# Algorithm Overview

## Stated Problem

### Assumptions

- Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages, and the ID number of each package is unique.
- The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 miles per hour and have an infinite amount of gas with no need to stop.
- There are no collisions.
- Three trucks and two drivers are available for deliveries. Each driver stays with the same truck as long as that truck is in service.
- Drivers leave the hub no earlier than 8:00 a.m., with the truck loaded, and can return to the hub for packages if needed.
- The delivery and loading times are instantaneous (i.e., no time passes while at a delivery or when moving packages to a truck at the hub). This time is factored into the calculation of the average speed of the trucks.
- There is up to one special note associated with a package.
- The delivery address for package #9, Third District Juvenile Court, is wrong and will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. WGUPS is aware that the address is incorrect and will be updated at 10:20 a.m. However, WGUPS does not know the correct address (410 S. State St., Salt Lake City, UT 84111) until 10:20 a.m.
- The distances provided in the “WGUPS Distance Table” are equal regardless of the direction traveled.
- The day ends when all 40 packages have been delivered.
